# Positron

Positron is a simple extension of Electron JS, HTML/CSS, Angular TypeScript, and C++ to build fast cross-platform desktop applications. It initially started as a template project to be used for referencing. Slowly over time it is evolving into a way to combine the fast backend runtime of native C/C++ code and the flexibility of a comprehensive frontend web stack.

Currently supports Windows - with macOS and Linux support planned. Setup scripts support Visual Studio 2022 by default.

## Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) (preferably a recent version)

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned, run `scripts/Setup.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Once you've opened the solution, you can run the WalnutApp project to see a basic example (code in `WalnutApp.cpp`). I recommend modifying that WalnutApp project to create your own application, as everything should be setup and ready to go.
