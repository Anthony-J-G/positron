# Positron

Positron is a template designed to speed up the design, prototyping, and iteration of native cross platform applications as an extension of ElectronJS. This allows for creating frontends using a variety of pre-existing web development frameworks. Additionally included in the Positron template is an interface for extending native C/C++ code into Electron via the Node.JS API.

The template initially started as an easy way to bootstrap new Electron applications. Slowly over time, it has started evolving into a way to acheive the best of three worlds, the flexiblity and formatting of an HTML/CSS/JS frontend application, the cross-platform availablity of an Electron JS web app, and the raw low-level power of native C/C++ code.
