# Positron

Positron is a simple extension of Electron JS, HTML/CSS, Angular TypeScript, and C++ to build fast cross-platform desktop applications. It initially started as a template project to be used for referencing when making new Electron applications. Slowly over time, it has started evolving into a way to acheive the best of three worlds, the flexiblity and formatting of an HTML/CSS/JS frontend application, the cross-platform availablity of an Electron JS web app, and the speed and power of native C/C++ code.

Positron is currently in development and most features should be considered experimental.
